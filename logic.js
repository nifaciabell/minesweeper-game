// Use a function to create the board.

// For loop to loop over a square in the grid 

// Create a new variable using the DOM that is assigned to create 100 divs since I am looping through 100x

// Set an attribute 'id' to each square to call on later 

// Put squares that were just created into the grid div by using appendChild method

// Create a variable set to an empty array outside of my function. 

// In the global scope create a variable of bombAccount 

// In the function create an array 

// Push created individual square into square array --> this will create an array of 100 squares

// ** The fill() method changes all elements in an array to a static value, from a start index (default 0) to an end index (default array.length). It returns the modified array.

 // Create shuffled game array with random bombs

 // Merge arrays so that I can be able to randomize the elements.

//  const shuffleArray = mergeArrays.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());
 // This method puts the elements into random order. 

 //---> Now that I have an array with randomize elements I need to insert this array into my grid. Each cell created in my div needs to be either a bomb or safe cell. Insert shuffleArray into my empty squares array.

 // Now that the bombs have been added to the board/grid now I need to add the numbers. 
// In minesweeper if a cell is clicked that is a number then the bomb is adjacent to that number I need to create a code that will allow me to create a pattern so that the user will have an idea where the bomb is based on the number.
