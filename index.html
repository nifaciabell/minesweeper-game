      <p>
        Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares. Safe
        squares have numbers telling you how many mines touch the square. You
        can use the number clues to solve the game by opening all of the safe
        squares. If you click on a mine you lose the game! You open squares with
        the left mouse button and put flags on mines with the right mouse
        button. Pressing the right mouse button again changes your flag into a
        question mark. When you open a square that does not touch any mines, it
        will be empty and the adjacent squares will automatically open in all
        directions until reaching squares that contain numbers. A common
        strategy for starting games is to randomly click until you get a big
        opening with lots of numbers.The game ends when all safe squares have
        been opened. A counter shows the number of mines without flags, and a
        clock shows your time in seconds.
